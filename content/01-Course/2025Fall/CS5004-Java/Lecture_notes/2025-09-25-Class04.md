## Recursive Data Structure
- Static Classes/Data/Methods
- Linked Lists

### abstract data type (ADT)
- higher-order functions on Java class

- existing collections in Java
	- LinkedList
	- ArrayList
	- arrays

Why need static used method?

- ArrayList and LinkedListed are implementations of Interface List
- List is an interface

- what is *Self-Referential Composition*?
	- **Self-Referential Composition** means a class contains **a field (or fields) of its own type**.

- Composition -> `has a`
	- Eg: `Book` class has a `Person` class

- Q: What is *Recursive Structures*?
	- A recursive structure is a data structure that is defined in terms of itself.
	- Eg. Linked List

- Q: Dynamic Dispatch
	- Run time decision

- Q: Why model a recursive list with an interface (e.g., `IListOfBooks`) instead of a concrete node class?”?
	- **Polymorphism & flexibility:** `rest` can be an `ElementNode` **or** an `EmptyNode` (end sentinel), or any other implementation.
	- **Avoids `null` checks:** Use an `EmptyNode` to terminate recursion safely.
	- **Encapsulation of invariants:** Each implementation enforces its own behavior (e.g., `count()` is `0` in `EmptyNode`).
	- **Easier testing & extension:** Swap in test doubles; add new node types without changing existing code.
	- **Lower coupling:** Code depends on the **abstraction**, not a specific concrete class (SOLID’s _D_ and _L_ help here).
