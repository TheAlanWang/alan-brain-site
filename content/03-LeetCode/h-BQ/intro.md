#### BQ: Introduction
Hi, my name is Alan. I am currently a second-year master student in Computer Science at Northeastern University. 

Before my studies here, I graduated from the University of Sydney with a degree in Finance and Big Data, and I also completed a bachelor’s degree in Accounting.

After graduation, I gained about five years of woking experience. I worked as a consultant at Cubewise, which is an IBM partner, and then joined Deloitte as a consultant focused more on data and digital transformation. More recently work experience, I moved into a software engineering role at a financial firm.

Across these experiences, I really enjoyed full-stack development and creating engaging AI applications. I am looking for an internship where I can apply my skills and gaining hands-on experience.
