# Question
### Restate the problem
Given a string, Unix-style absolute path, return simplified **canonical** path.
## Method
### Key idea
Split path by `/`, iterate each directory token, use a stack to simulate directory navigation, then rebuild the path.
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Edge case
- `"/"` return `"/"`
- `"/../"` → `"/"` (can’t go above root)
- Tokens like `"..."` are **not special** → keep them (folder name)

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for token in path.split("/"):
            if token in ("", "."):
                continue
                
            if token == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                    continue
            else:
                stack.append(token)
        
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
