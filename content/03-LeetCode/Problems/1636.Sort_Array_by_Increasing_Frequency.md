Link: [1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/)
# Question
### Restate the problem
Give an integer array `nums`, sort the array so that lower frequency comes first. if frequency is the same, return the larger value. Return the sorted array.

Method 1 - hashmap + heap
Method 2 - hashmap + sort
## Method - built-in sort
### Approach
Count the frequency of each number with a hash map / `Counter`, then sort `nums` using a custom key: `(frequency[x], -x)`
### Complexity
- Time complexity is O($nlogn$)
- Space Complexity is O(n)
### Edge Cases
- Negative numbers / zero
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key = lambda x: (freq[x], -x))
        return sorted_nums
```

## Method 2 - heap
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(n + k log k)` (Counter + heap ops + output expansion)
	- `k` is unique values
- Space Complexity: `O(k)` heap + `O(n)` output
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        heap = []
        
        # time is O(nlogn)
        for num, count in freq.items(): # O(n)
            heapq.heappush(heap, (count, -num)) # O(logn)
        
        res = []
        while heap:
            freq, num = heapq.heappop(heap)
            for _ in range(freq):
                res.append(-num)
        
        return res
```
