# Question
Link: [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/) - Medium
### Restate the problem
- Given a 2d grid, with `0` and `1`. `1` is land, `0` is water.
- An island is connected 4-directionally (up/down/left/right).
- Return the maximum number of land cells in any island.
# Method
### Key Approach
- Scan every cell
- When I find a land cell that has not been visited, that cell must be the state of a new island, so I run BFS from it to compute its area.
- During the BFS, I expand to 4 neighbors. If a neighbor is in-bounds, is land, and unvisited, I mark it visited and push it into the queue.
- The BFS returns the island's area, and I update the global maximum.
#### Why it work:
- Each land cell is added to the queue at most once.
- BFS visits exactly the connected components, so the counted `size` is exactly the island's area.
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O($m*n$)
- Space Complexity: O($m*n$)
### Edge Case
- If there is no grid, return `0`
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
	        return 0
            
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        dirs = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))
        res = 0

        def bfs(r, c):
            if not grid or not grid[0]:
                return 0

            queue = deque()
            queue.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))
            size = 1

            while queue:
                r, c = queue.popleft()
                for dr, dc in dirs:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if (
                        (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols) and
                        grid[nr][nc] == 1 and
                        (nr, nc) not in visited
                    ):
                        size += 1
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
                        visited.add((nr, nc))
            return size

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1 and (r, c) not in visited:
                    max_area = bfs(r, c)
                    res = max(res, max_area)
        
        return res
```

Jan-16-2026 solved, debug it myself. Mistake: Type pitfall use `int 1` not `str "1"`.
