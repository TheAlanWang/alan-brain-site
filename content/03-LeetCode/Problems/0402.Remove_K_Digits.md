Link: [402. Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/) - Medium
Track: NeetCode150
# Question
### Restate the problem
- Given string `num` that represents a **non-negative integer** (like `"1432219"`) and an integer `k`
- Return the answer as a **string**, and it must **not have leading zeros**
- remove exactly `k` digits, so the resulting number is **as small as possible**.

> Whenever the next digit is smaller than the previous digit, we should remove the previous larger digit (if we still have k removals) to make the number as small as possible.

Method 1
Method 2
## Method - Stack
### Approach - monotonic increasing stack
- Use stack to keep digits:
    - Scan digits left → right.
    - While `k > 0` and `stack[-1] > ch`, pop the stack (remove that larger digit), decrement `k`.
    - Push `ch`.
- **If k is still > 0 after the scan**, remove from the end (`stack[:-k]`) because the number is already increasing, so the tail digits are the best to delete.
- Result: `res = ''.join(stack).lstrip('0')`; if empty return `"0"`

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Edge Case
- `k == len(num)`, return "0"

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in num:
            while stack and stack[-1] > char and k != 0:
                k -= 1
                stack.pop()
            
            stack.append(char)
        
        if k > 0:
            stack = stack[:-k]

        tmp = ("").join(stack)
        res = tmp.lstrip('0')
        
        return str(res) if res else "0"   
```

# History
Jan-25-2026 Solved w bug
- `stack = stack[:k]` to slice

Jan-24-2026 Solved w bug
- `lstrip` only works on `str`

Jan-22-2026 Solved w bug, took too long time
- `digital string` can compare
- use `while` to deal with stack
- `str.join()` works with any iterable of strings
- `lstrip()` only work with strings, to eliminate `'0'`
