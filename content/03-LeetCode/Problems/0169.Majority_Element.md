Track: Amazon tag
# Question
### Restate the problem
- Given `nums`, list of integers
- Return `num`, the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times (the majority element).
- The majority element is guaranteed to exist.

---

Method 1 - hashmap
Method 2 - can improve to O(1)
## Method 1 - Counter
### Approach
- Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each number.
- Iterate through `(num, freq)` in the counter:
    - If `freq > n // 2`, return `num`.

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Edge Case
- if not `nums`, return something

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        count = Counter(nums)
        for num, freq in count.items():
            if freq > n // 2:
                return num
```

## Method 2 - O(1)
