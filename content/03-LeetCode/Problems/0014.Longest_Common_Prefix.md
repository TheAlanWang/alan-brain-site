Link: [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)
# Question
### Restate the problem

---

Method 1 compare the whole prefix
Method 2 horizontal scanning with pointers
## Method
### Approach
- Pick first word as a *reference*
- Compare characters column by column across all strings
- Stop at first mismatch
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O($m*n$)
	- m = length of the shortest word
	- n = number of strings
- Space Complexity: O(1)
### Edge Case
- Empty input list
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        if not strs:
            return ""
        
        min_length = min(len(word) for word in strs)
        p = 0
        while p < min_length:
            char = strs[0][p]
            for word in strs:
                if char != word[p]:
                    return strs[0][:p]
            
            p += 1
        
        return strs[0][:p]
```
