# Question
Link: [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
### Restate the problem
- We're given a 2D grid of `'1'` and `'0'`, where`'1'` is land and `'0'` is water. 
- An island is a group of land cells connected up/down/left/right.
- Return how many separate islands exists
# Approach
### Method - BFS
- Scan every cell. If I see a `'1'` that I haven’t visited, that means I found a new island, so I do `res += 1`.  
- Then I run **BFS** from that cell using a queue and expand in 4 directions. Any neighbor that’s inside the grid and is `'1'` and not visited, I add it to the queue and mark it visited.
- After BFS finishes, all land in that island is marked, so I won’t count it again.
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O($m*n$)
- Space Complexity: O($m*n$)
### Edge Case
- No grid
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
		if not grid or not grid[0]:
			return 0
            
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        dirs = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))
        def bfs(r, c):
            queue = deque()
            queue.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))
            while queue:
                r, c = queue.popleft()
                for dr, dc in dirs:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if not(0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols):
                        continue
                    if grid[nr][nc] == '1' and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
                        visited.add((nr, nc))
        res = 0
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visited:
                    bfs(r, c)
                    res += 1

        return res
```
