Track: NeetCode150
# Question
### Restate the problem
Given a string containing only the characters `()[]{}`, determine if it is valid. 
A string is valid if every opening bracket is closed by the **same type** of bracket, and brackets are closed in the **correct nested order** (the most recent unmatched opening bracket is closed first). Return a boolean.

> Use a stack to track opening brackets; each closing bracket must match the stack top, and the string is valid only if the stack ends empty.
---

Method 1
Method 2
## Method - Hashmap + stack
### Approach
- Use a stack to store opening brackets and a hashmap that maps each closing bracket to its matching opening bracket. 
- Scan the string: 
	- if I see an opening bracket, I push it onto the stack. 
	- If I see a closing bracket, the stack must not be empty and the top element must match the expected opening bracket from the map; otherwise I return false. 

- After the scan, the string is valid only if the stack is empty.

### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Edge Case
- If a closing parenthesis/bracket appears first
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []

        dic = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

        for par in s:
            if par in dic:
                if not stack:
                    return False

                op_par = stack.pop()
                if op_par != dic[par]:
                    return False
            else:
                stack.append(par)
        
        return False if stack else True
```
