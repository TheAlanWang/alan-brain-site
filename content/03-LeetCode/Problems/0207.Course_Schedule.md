# Question
### Restate the problem
Given an integer number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs
Each pair `b->a` means course `b` must be taken before course `a`
Return whether it is possible to finish all courses
# Method
### Approach - graph `topological sort`
- Build a directed graph where an edge `pre -> course`
- An `indegree` array to record the number of prerequisites for each course

- Initialize a queue with all courses that have `indegree` 0
- While the queue is not empty:
    - Pop one course from the queue (this course is completed)
    - For each neighboring course:
        - Decrease its `indegree`
        - If `indegree` becomes 0, add it to the queue
- If all courses are processed, return true; otherwise, return false
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(V+E)
- Space Complexity: **O(V+E)**
	- e.g., graph = `{0:[1], 1:[]}`, store edge
### Edge Case
- numCourses = 0 → return true
- **cycle course**
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        visited = set()
        
        for course, precourse in prerequisites:
            graph[precourse].append(course)
            indegree[course] += 1
        
        queue = deque()
        for idx, count in enumerate(indegree):
            if count == 0:
                queue.append(idx)
                
        while queue:
            cur = queue.popleft()
            visited.add(cur)
            for nei in graph[cur]:
                indegree[nei] -= 1
                if indegree[nei] == 0:
                    queue.append(nei)
                    # visited.add(nei)
        
        return len(visited) == numCourses
```
