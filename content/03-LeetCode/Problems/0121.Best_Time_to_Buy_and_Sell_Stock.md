Track: NeetCode150
# Question
### Restate the problem
Given an array, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day`i`, choose one day to buy and a later day to sell to maximize profit. Return the maximum profit, return `0` if no profitable transition exists.

---

Method 1 - Brute force, loop twice, cal profit, O($n^2$) time, O(1) space.
Method 2 - Greedy
## Method - Greedy
### Approach
invariant: `min_price` is always the minimum of all prices seen so far. `max_profit` is always the best achievable profit up to the current day

Iterate through each price:
- Update `min_price`
- Compute profit if selling today and update `max_profit`
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
### Edge Case
- If prices are decreasing, return 0
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_buy = float("inf")
        max_profit = 0
        for p in prices:
            min_buy = min(min_buy, p)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, p - min_buy)
        
        return max_profit
```
