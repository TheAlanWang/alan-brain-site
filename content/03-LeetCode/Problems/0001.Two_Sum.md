Track: NeetCode150
# Question
### Restate the problem
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices of the two numbers** such that their sum equals `target`.
- Each input has exactly one solution
- You may not use the same element twice
# Method
### Approach - Hashmap
We iterate through the array once while maintaining a hash map that stores each number and its index.

For each number `x`:
1. Compute its complement: `target - x`
2. If the complement already exists in the hash map, we have found the solution:
    - Return the stored index of the complement and the current index    
3. Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the map
    
This ensures we find the pair in a single pass.

### Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
### Edge Case
- Negative numbers
- Duplicate values
### Code        
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in dic:
                return [dic[target - num], idx]
            
            dic[num] = idx
```
