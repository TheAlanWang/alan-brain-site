# 👋 Hi, I'm Alan

Welcome to **Alan’s Brain** — my public knowledge system.

## 🧠 What is this site?
This is my **digital brain** — built from my **Obsidian notes** and published using **Quartz**.

This site is where I think in public:
- how I learn computer science  
- how I build software  
- how I prepare for interviews  
- how I turn ideas into systems
