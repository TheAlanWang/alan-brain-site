```python
string = ""
set1 = set() # 
list1 = [] # square brackets
tuple1 = ()
dic = {} # curly braces
```
### mutable vs immutable
Mutable = can be changed _in place_ after it’s created.  
Immutable = cannot be changed after it’s created (you must create a _new_ object instead).

- list: mutable
- set: mutable, No duplicates, Unordered, can add, remove
- tuple: immutable
