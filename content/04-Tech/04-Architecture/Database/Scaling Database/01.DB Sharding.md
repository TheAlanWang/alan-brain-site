Data sharding:
- a way to scale a database
	- splitting a large dataset into smaller pieces (shards), and 
	- storing those pieces on different database servers/nodes.
- Each shard holds only a subset of the rows (horizontal split).
- A shard key (e.g., `user_id`) decides which shard a record goes to.


**Cardinality = number of distinct values** in a column/attribute.
