- For each shard/partition, having a single copy has a few disadvantages
	- A single instance can be **easily overwhelmed** by a large number of requests
	- A single instance can be close to some users but far from others, who will experience greater **latencies**.
	- A single instance provides low overall availability

- The improvement is to add copies/**replicas**, in different availability zones
- need to consider replicas consistent(accuracy, latency, availability)
	- Example DynamoDB, only two levels
		1) Strong Consistency - A read is guaranteed to return the latest committed write
			- Accuracy
			- increase latency
			- Reduce availability during failure
		2) Eventual Consistency - Reads may temporarily return old data right after a write.
			- Latency
			- Availability: keeps working even if some replicas are behind
