### Stable vs Unstable
- Stable: If two elements have the **same key**, their **relative order stays the same** after sorting.
- Unstable: If two elements have the **same key**, their **relative order may change** after sorting.

Example:
- Before: `[2a, 1, 2b]`
- After: unstable is `[1, 2b, 2a]`, stable is `[1, 2a, 2b]`
